- the main assignment of the project is to build a simple but functional CRUD application using PHP
- currently in the process of restructuring the project around the MVC Architecture.
- I also plan on transferring the code from procedural to object-oriented.

### Built with

- very simple frontend consisting of only HTML and CSS 
- PHP and MySQL 
- no frameworks or libraries were hurt in the making of this application!
