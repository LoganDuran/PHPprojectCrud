the main assignment of the project is to build a simple but functional CRUD application using PHP;
currently in the process of restructuring the project around the MVC Architecture;
I also plan on transferring the code from procedural to object-oriented;

### Built with

- very simple frontend consisting of only HTML and CSS 
- the rest is handled by PHP and MySQL 
- everything was coded from scratch manually, although I did have to reference quite a lot of online resources
- no frameworks or libraries were hurt in the making of this application!
